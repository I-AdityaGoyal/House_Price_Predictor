# House Price Predictor 🏠💲🔮

This project aims to predict house prices using various Machine Learning regression models. It includes functions for data visualization 📊, model training 🏋️‍♀️ (e.g., Linear Regression, Decision Tree Regression, Random Forest Regression), cross-validation ♻️, scoring ⭐️, and grid search 🔎🔄.

## Usage 🚀

1. Prepare your dataset: Ensure that you have a well-prepared dataset with relevant features and corresponding house prices.

2. Data Visualization: Utilize the provided functions and libraries for visualizing the dataset, exploring relationships between features, and gaining insights.

3. Model Training: Train different regression models (Linear Regression, Decision Tree Regression, Random Forest Regression) using the provided functions. Experiment with different hyperparameters to improve model performance.

4. Cross-Validation and Scoring: Evaluate your models using cross-validation techniques to assess their generalization performance. Calculate relevant scoring metrics such as mean squared error, R-squared, etc.

5. Grid Search: Fine-tune your models using grid search to find the optimal combination of hyperparameters that yield the best performance.

6. Testing: Evaluate your best model on the provided test dataset to assess its performance on unseen data.
